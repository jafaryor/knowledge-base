## Technical Debt
Very simply, technical debt can be defined as the engineering work you owe yourself because something caused a gap between what you should have done versus what you did do.

### What causes technical debt
* Poor conception

    The rush in delivering faster often results in poorly designed software.

* Poor scheduling

    Underestimation during software development estimation process often causes technical debt.

* Bad development practices

    A lack of development good practices and conventions will lead developers to implement their design, rebuild over and over the same logic and format their codes the way they want rather than the way it is commonly accepted in the particular software project.

* Outdated technology

    With each technology improvement, new technical debt can arise.

### Types:
* Source code formatting
* Low test coverage
* Lack of modularity
* Code complexity
* Lack of documentation

### How to measure:
One approach is to perform a static analysis of code using tools that support the analysis. Like:
* [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/)
* [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
* [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)
* [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler)
