# The difference between UI and UX
> “User experience” encompasses (охватывать) all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products. UX is literally everything that has impact on your overall experience as a user of “something.”

> User interface design (UI) is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers […] The goal of user interface design is to make the user’s interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals.

The simplest definition I am able to come up with is this (you be the judge if it’s good enough):
* UX design deals with the entire interaction that a user has with a company, its products,
    services, website, app, and so on. UX touches upon the entire journey a user embarks on
    when they decide to give “something” a chance. It covers the complete overall experience
    that a user has with that “something.”
* UI design, on the other hand, deals with the specific things that the user will actually
    interact with while on that journey.
Or, in other words, UX deals with purpose, while UI deals with appearance and functionality.

Picture yourself in a cafe. Think of the cup, the table, the chair, the coffee beans as the UI of the place. Now, think of the way the coffee is made, the ambience, the service, the music as the UX aspect. UX is literally everything that has impact on your overall experience as a user of “something.”

Next time you’re in a car, pay closer attention to the button/switch that controls the hazard lights. Traditionally, in most cars, it’s the most central, best visible switch on the dashboard. I argue that the placement of that switch is a result of a UX decision. While the look itself is a UI decision.
