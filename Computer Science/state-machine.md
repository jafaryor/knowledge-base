## State Machine
A __state machine__ is a concept used in designing computer programs or digital logic. There are two types of state machines: _finite_ and _infinite_ state machines.

A __finite-state machine__ (`FSM`) is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.

The `FSM` can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.

An `FSM` is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

Finite state machines are of two types - __deterministic finite state machines__ and __non-deterministic finite state machines__. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

The finite state machine has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the Turing machine. The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) can do but a `FSM` cannot. This is because a `FSM`'s memory is limited by the number of states it has. `FSM`s are studied in the more general field of [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory).
