# Software Development Approaches
## TDD & BDD
Test-driven development (TDD), is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

Behavior Driven testing is an extension of TDD. Like in TDD in BDD also we write tests first and the add application code. The major difference that we get to see here are
* Tests are written in plain descriptive English type grammar
* Tests are explained as behavior of application and are more user focused
* Using examples to clarify requirements

Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that has emerged from TDD (Test Driven Development) but differs by being written in a shared language, which improves communication between tech and non-tech teams and stakeholders. In both development approaches, tests are written ahead of the code, but in BDD, tests are more user-focused and based on the systemâ€™s behavior.

Unit Testing gives you the __what__. Test-Driven Development gives you the __when__. Behavior Driven-Development gives you the __how__. Although you can use each individually, you should combine them for best results as they complement each other very nicely.

## Data-driven Developmment
Data driven progamming is a programming model where the data itself controls the flow of the program and not the program logic. It is a model where you control the flow by offering different data sets to the program where the program logic is some generic form of flow or of state-changes.

## Event-driven Development
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program. An event-driven application is designed to detect events as they occur, and then deal with them using an appropriate event-handling procedure. The idea is an extension of interrupt-driven programming of the kind found in early command-line environments such as DOS, and in embedded systems (where the application is implemented as firmware).

## Timeboxing
Timeboxing is the approach for completing the project incrementally by breaking it down into splitting the project in portions, each with a fixed budget and a delivery date. For each portion a number of requirements are prioritised and selected. Because time and budget are fixed, the only remaining variables are the requirements.
