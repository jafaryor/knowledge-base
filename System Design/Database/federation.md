## Database Federation
A __data federation__ is a software process that allows multiple databases to function as one. This virtual database takes data from a range of sources and converts them all to a common model. This provides a single source of data for front-end applications.

### Advantages
* Flexible data sharing.
* Autonomy among the database components.
* Access heterogeneous data in a unified way.
* No tight coupling of applications with legacy databases.

### Disadvantages
* Adds more hardware and additional complexity.
* Joining data from two databases is complex.
* Dependence on autonomous data sources.
* Query performance and scalability.
