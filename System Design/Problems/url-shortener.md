## URL Shortener
A URL shortener service creates an alias or a short URL for a long URL. Users are redirected to the original URL when they visit these short links.

URL shortener saves space in general when we are sharing URLs. Users are also less likely to mistype shorter URLs. Moreover, we can also optimize links across devices, this allows us to track individual links.

### 1. Requirements
Functional requirements:
* Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias for it.
* Users should be redirected to the original URL when they visit the short link.
* Links should expire after a default timespan.

Non-functional requirements:
* High availability with minimal latency.
* The system should be scalable and efficient.

Extended requirements:
* Prevent abuse of services.
* Record analytics and metrics for redirections.
