Protocol upgrade mechanism
    This mechanism is always client initiated (with one exception: it's possible for the
    server to require an upgrade to TLS), and the server may accept or refuse the switch
    to the new protocol. This makes it possible to start a connection using a commonly-used
    protocol, such as HTTP/1.1, then request that the connection switch to HTTP/2 or
    even to WebSockets.

Handshake
    When the client wishes to upgrade to a new protocol, it does so by sending a normal
    request of any type to the server (GET, POST, etc.). The request needs to be configured
    specially to include the upgrade request, however.
    In particular, the request requires these two additional headers:
        Connection: Upgrade
            The Connection header is set to "Upgrade" to indicate that an upgrade is requested.
        Upgrade: protocols
            The Upgrade header specifies one or more comma-separated protocol names,
            in order of preference.

You can upgarde to HTTP/2, WebSocket, HTTP over TLS

The main advantages of upgrading to HTTP over TLS are that you can avoid using URL redirection
    from "http://" to "https://" on the server and you can easily use TLS on virtual hosts.
