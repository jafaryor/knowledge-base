## Scalability
Scalability is the measure of how well a system responds to changes by adding or removing resources to meet demands.

### Vertical scaling
Vertical scaling (also known as scaling up) expands a system's scalability by adding more power to an existing machine. In other words, vertical scaling refers to improving an application's capability via increasing hardware capacity.

#### Advantages
* Simple to implement
* Easier to manage
* Data consistent

#### Disadvantages
* Risk of high downtime
* Harder to upgrade
* Can be a single point of failure

### Horizontal scaling
Horizontal scaling (also known as scaling out) expands a system's scale by adding more machines. It improves the performance of the server by adding more instances to the existing pool of servers, allowing the load to be distributed more evenly.

#### Advantages
* Increased redundancy
* Better fault tolerance
* Flexible and efficient
* Easier to upgrade

#### Disadvantages
* Increases complexity
* Data inconsistency
* Increased load on downstream services
