## Web Accessibility
Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with disabilities.

Best practices:
1. Clear and logical designs benefit everyone, as does consistent navigation. The big difference, though, is that inconveniences like cluttered screens or navigation inconsistency become even bigger obstacles for people who are visually impaired.
2. Power users in general prefer keyboard navigation, and the availability of hotkey shortcuts is always a welcome addition.
3. The biggest obstacle for visually impaired users is text clarity, so designers should take every measure to increase legibility (clarity of letters) and readability (clarity of text blocks).
4. Donâ€™t rely exclusively on color. Color-blindness affects close to 10% of the population.
5. Order content in HTML for screen readers.
