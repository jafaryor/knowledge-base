## Angular
Angular is a known Typescript-based JavaScript MVVM framework, founded in 2009, backed by Google and used for developing highly interactive web applications. It is widely used by Google, Forbes, WhatsApp and many other Fortune 500 companies.

### Benefits:
* Angular’s created to be used alongside with Typescript. And has exceptional support for it.
* Angular-language-service — which allows intelligence and autocomplete inside of component external HTML template files.
* New features like a generation of Angular based npm libraries from CLI, generation, and development of WebComponents based on Angular.
* Detailed documentation that allows getting all necessary information for the individual developer without asking his colleagues. However, this requires more time for education.
* One-way data binding that enables singular behavior for the app which minimized risks of possible errors.
* MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) that allows developers to work separately on the same app section using the same set of data.
* Dependency injection of the features related to the components with modules and modularity in general.
* Structure and architecture specifically created for great project scalability

### Limitations:
* Migrating legacy systems from AngularJS to Angular requires time:

    The difference between AngularJS and Angular is large, so is the path of migration from the past to the future.

* Steep learning curve

    Variety of different structures(Injectables, Components, Pipes, Modules etc.) makes it a bit harder to learn in comparison with React and Vue.js, which have an only “Component” in mind.

* TypeScript

    While TypeScript improves maintainability of code, having to learn it doesn’t make the curve gentler.

> Angular is the most mature of the frameworks, has good backing in terms of contributors and is a complete package. However, the learning curve is steep and concepts of development in Angular may put off new developers. Angular is a good choice for companies with large teams and developers who already use TypeScript.

## React
Maintained by Facebook, React is a JavaScript library for building UI components for web applications. It is widely used by Facebook(duh!), Uber, Netflix, Udemy and may more.

### Benefits:
* Easy to learn.
* Developers spend more time writing modern JavaScript, and less time worrying about the framework-specific code.
* Updates process is optimized and accelerated via Virtual DOM.
* JSX makes components/blocks code readable. It displays how components are plugged or combined with.
* Has a fairly low learning curve.
* Uses JSX for template creation instead of the usual JavaScript.
* Uses just one direction data flow — downward. And in this type of structure, there is no way that child elements can affect the parent data.
* Uses Virtual DOM which greatly increases the Speed of your app and only updates the parts where the changes have occurred.
* Excellent cross platform supporter.
* Easy to adopt and has UI focused Design.

### Limitations:
* React is unopinionated and leaves developers to make choices about the best way to develop. This can be tackled by strong project leadership and good processes.
* In ReactJS you need more code for development then it’s counterparts.
* Not using isomorphic approach to exploit application leads to search engines indexing problems.
* Lots of developers dislike JSX React’s documentation, manuals are difficult for newcomers’ understanding.

> React is just old enough to be mature and has a huge number of contributions from the community. It is gaining widespread acceptance. The job market for React is really good, and the future for this framework looks bright.
React looks like a good choice for someone getting started with front-end JavaScript frameworks, startups and developers who like some flexibility. The ability to integrate with other frameworks seamlessly gives it a great advantage for those who would like some flexibility in their code.

## Vue
New in the market, Vue.js is one of the most-discussed and rapidly growing JavaScript framework. Released in February 2014, you can build interactive UIs using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is widely used by Alibaba. Gitlab, and is being picked up by many developers globally.

### Benefits:
* Empowered HTML. This means that Vue.js has many similar characteristics with Angular and this can help to optimize HTML blocks handling with the use of different components.
* Detailed documentation. Vue.js has very circumstantial documentation which can fasten learning curve for developers and save a lot of time to develop an app using only the basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.
* Adaptability. It provides a rapid switching period from other frameworks to Vue.js because of the similarity with Angular and React in terms of design and architecture.
* Awesome integration. Vue.js can be used for both building single-page applications and more difficult web interfaces of apps. The main thing is that smaller interactive parts can be easily integrated into the existing infrastructure with no negative effect on the entire system.
* Large scaling. Vue.js can help to develop pretty large reusable templates that can be made with no extra time allocated for that according to its simple structure.
* Tiny size. Vue.js can weight around 20KB keeping its speed and flexibility that allows reaching much better performance in comparison to other frameworks.

### Limitations
* Lack of some common solid plugins/components

    Due to the relative age of Vue.js, there is a fairly well known lack of common plugins that make working with various tools easier. Google Maps being a pretty common example. I have yet to work with Google Maps within Vue.js, and always resort to vanilla Javascript.

* Evolving fast

    A lot of Vue learners have mentioned that Vue.js is evolving rather fast, so a lot of the examples you find online may be outdated. I’d always invest in a solid online course, a good read of the documentation and a solid book to boot.

* Minor issues with iOS and Safari

* Reactivity caveats

    If you read the documentation, there are some reactivity caveats, like setting an item from an array directly (e.g., `this.items[key]=value`) or adding a new data property. This might be both good and bad depending on use cases. However, for most cases it's nice to have everything specified upfront inside data.

> Vue is new to the arena, without the backing of a major company.
However, it has done really well in the last few years to come out as a strong competitor for Angular and React. This is perhaps playing a role with a lot of Chinese giants like Alibaba and Baidu picking Vue as their primary front-end JavaScript framework. Vue should be your choice if you prefer simplicity, but also like flexibility.
