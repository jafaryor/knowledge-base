A __library__ is a reusable piece of code which you use as it comes.

A __framework__ is a piece of code which dictates the architecture your project will follow.

The framework will provide you with hooks and callbacks, so that you build on it — it will then call your plugged-in code whenever it wishes, a phenomenon called _Inversion of Control_.
