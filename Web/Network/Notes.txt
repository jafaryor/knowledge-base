Though HTTP/2 adds some complexity, by embedding HTTP messages in frames to improve performance,
    the basic structure of messages has stayed the same since HTTP/1.0.

Sometimes it is more important that the data be sent quickly and without pauses than that the
    stream be reliable. streaming video often uses UDP as a transport protocol because the
    occasional loss of a packet is acceptable. It is preferable that the image quality suffer
    as a result of lost packets, rather than the video stream suffer jitter or pauses (lag)
    as a result of TCP synchronization.

Google is experimenting with QUIC which builds on UDP to provide
    a more reliable and efficient transport protocol.
