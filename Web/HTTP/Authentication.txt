HTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication. The most
    common HTTP authentication scheme is the "Basic" authentication.

The server responds to a client with a 401 (Unauthorized) response status and
    provides information on how to authorize with a WWW-Authenticate response
    header containing at least one challenge. A client that wants to authenticate
    itself with a server can then do so by including an Authorization request
    header field with the credentials. Usually a client will present a password
    prompt to the user and will then issue the request including the correct
    Authorization header.

Proxy authentication
    The same challenge and response mechanism can be used for proxy authentication.
    In this case, it is an intermediate proxy that requires authentication.
    As both resource authentication and proxy authentication can coexist, a
    different set of headers and status codes is needed. In the case of proxies,
    the challenging status code is 407 (Proxy Authentication Required), the
    Proxy-Authenticate response header contains at least one challenge
    applicable to the proxy, and the Proxy-Authorization request header is
    used for providing the credentials to the proxy server.

Access forbidden
    If a (proxy) server receives valid credentials that are not adequate to gain
    access for a given resource, the server should respond with the 403 Forbidden
    status code. Unlike 401 Unauthorized or 407 Proxy Authentication Required,
    authentication is impossible for this user.
