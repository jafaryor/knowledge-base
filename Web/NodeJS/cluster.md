## Cluster
A single instance of Node.js runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems, the user will sometimes want to launch a cluster of Node.js processes to handle the load.

The [cluster module](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) allows easy creation of child processes that all share server ports.
