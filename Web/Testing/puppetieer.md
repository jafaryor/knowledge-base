# Puppetieer
Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:
* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
* Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
* Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
* Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
* Test Chrome Extensions.
