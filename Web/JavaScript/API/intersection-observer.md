## Intersection Observer
The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:
* Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.
* Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.
* Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.
* Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.
