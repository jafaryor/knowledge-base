## Reasoning for the selected recommendation
Jafar showed good enough skills as for A4 level.
He is able to keep the discussion going on a variety of topics keeping a friendly and open atmosphere.
He can become a team driver and that, who can kick off and establish processes on a new project.
Takes responsibility and knows how to work efficiently with teammates on a project.
Has expert knowledge of a few technical areas.

Jafar showed himself as an Engineer with good experience and a good performer during the session. He understands and knows common architecture solutions, modern technology stack, how to do a delivery of product with good quality and establish processes of it and how to deal with conflicts inside his team.

Jafar is a mature and experienced software engineer. Has good knowledge of a lot of topics and he can effectively use it in practice.
What was good and should be recognized
- Open-minded vision on technologies and challenges;
- Positive, easy to talk with and collaborate;
- Pre-sales participation;
- Knows how agile methodologies work and how to establish processes on a new project;
- Experienced with establishing code quality gates on the project;
- Wide vision and experience with different technologies;
- Jafar has sufficient knowledge of TypeScript and a good awareness of Angular stack and how to prepare​ and combine a team for it;
- Can deal with simple conflicts inside the team, very polite and open to communication and opposite mind;
- Has good knowledge in code-quality support processes and how to deal with the ​tech debt issues during the ​development phase;
- Can name basic design patterns and their common usage;
- Good awareness​ of the ​onboarding process and it goals;
- Understanding of code quality importance, tools and process;
- Technical debt
- Experience and understanding testing (types, coverage);
- Web Security (CSS, CSRF, SQL injection);
- Knows how to build an offline JS application;
- Agile (Kanban, XP) - was able to name exact metrics and charts from Kanban;
What can be improved
Although assessment sessions are meant to be friendly and professional communication, the Committee wasn't able to efficiently use time and had to interrupt Jafar many times. Most of the answers were vague and abstract, in-depth with unimportant details while missing the initial matter. This could be a case for a 3-4 hour discussion but not on an important time-boxed session where the Committee aims to get deepness of knowledge in many spheres, not the ability to go around topics. As an example, a question about the usage of Typescript in a not experienced group: the answer could have been given less than in a minute explicitly naming pros/cons and alternative solutions.

- Decision-making skills. It was obvious that Jafar wasn't sure about some of his answers;
- Ability to explain his decision and provide an expert judgement;
- Don't hesitate to show engineering maturity and responsibility;
- Most of the answers were vague and superficial which required extra time to get the short-and-clear answers from him.
- Understanding how technologies/frameworks work under-the-hood;
- Should pay more attention to alternative technologies and their usage, such as RxJS with React, Flow, React Stack technologies and approaches, Vue JS, NodeJS and etc;
- Due to conflict resolving, it's very important to have 1:1 talks. Take in mind the goals of the opposite side and their motivation, fully understanding the object of conflict will help to resolve it. Jafar didn't mention these points;
- Not a lot of design patterns were named. Just a few of them, awareness​ of them will help to create and deliver maintenance​ code base in short terms;
- Technical debt, Jafar has knowledge but they could be improved;
- Typescript usage in an inexperienced group. At the beginning of the session, Jafar mentioned he would prefer using Typescript in most of the cases. But when it came to an alike question later the final answer was similar to "start with JS and see how it goes" which would definitely be a bad idea taking to account all details given to the initial question. Especially in such cases, Typescript can minimize issues connected with inexperienced developers and help to discipline ones.
- Web Components. Angular Elements, framework agnostic code.
- Server Side Rendering;
- Isomorphic Applications;
- Get more knowledge on how Javascript Engines work. Typescript DOES give performance boost because types do not change in runtime which makes code faster to run for an engine.
Suggestions to the candidate
Continue contribution in EPAM CC. Would be good to start a few internal projects in different technologies that are interesting and new for Jafar. Participation in pre-sales is also a great plus.
Pay attention to conflict solving and negotiations situations. EPAM has good internal courses for improving these skills.

Please try to give descriptive and short answers straight to the point, showing the best sides of your knowledge. If needed, you will be asked additional questions but usually, such a straightforward answer will not likely raise those.

- Improve soft skills. Mostly on engineering maturity.
- Attend behavioural training on communication/negotiation with the customer.
- Improve decision-making skills. Be more strict.
- Recall all the questions from the assessment and try to give short answers without redundant theory.
- Technical debt is not only about metrics from SonarCube, sometimes it cannot be measured by tools and lead should measure it manually, I believe it will be a good idea to improve knowledge on it, e.g. https://www.bmc.com/blogs/technical-debt-explained-the-complete-guide-to-understanding-and-dealing-with-technical-debt/
- Pay more attention to the delegation (there're many things a leader can't delegate), it's very important for the development team and to a leader. Correct usage of this skill is crucial here.
