Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious
    technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user
    perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or
    taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages.


The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser
    should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe> or <object> . Sites can use
    this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded
    into other sites.

Syntax
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are three possible directives for X-Frame-Options:
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://jafar.me/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directives
    If you specify DENY, not only will attempts to load the page in a frame fail when loaded from
    other sites, attempts to do so will fail when loaded from the same site. On the other hand,
    if you specify SAMEORIGIN, you can still use the page in a frame as long as the site including
    it in a frame is the same as the one serving the page.
        DENY
            The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.
        SAMEORIGIN
            The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself. The
            spec leaves it up to browser vendors to decide whether this option applies to the top
            level, the parent, or the whole chain. See Browser compatibility for details.
        ALLOW-FROM uri
            The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin.


The HTML <object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested
    browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
