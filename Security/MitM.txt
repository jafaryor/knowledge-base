A Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) intercepts a communication between two systems.
    For example, a Wi-Fi router can be compromised.

In physical mail and in online communication, MITM attacks are tough to defend. A few tips:
    * Don't just ignore certificate warnings. You could be connecting to a phishing
        server or an imposter server.
    * Sensitive sites without HTTPS encryption on public Wi-Fi networks aren't trustworthy.
    * Check for HTTPS in your address bar and ensure encryption is in-place before logging in.
