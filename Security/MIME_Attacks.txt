MIME sniffing
    In the absence of a MIME type, or in some other cases where a client believes they are
    incorrectly set, browsers may conduct MIME sniffing, which is guessing the correct MIME
    type by looking at the resource. Each browser performs this differently and under different
    circumstances. There are some security concerns with this practice, as some MIME types
    represent executable content and others not. Servers can block MIME sniffing by sending
    the X-Content-Type-Options along the Content-Type.

The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate
    that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be
    followed. This allows to opt-out (отказаться) of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words,
    it is a way to say that the webmasters knew what they were doing.
