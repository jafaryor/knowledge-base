Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to
    inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed by
    the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users.

Cross-site scripting attacks usually occur when
    1) data enters a Web app through an untrusted source (most often a Web request) or
    2) dynamic content is sent to a Web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content often includes JavaScript, but sometimes HTML, Flash, or any other
    code the browser can execute.

The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and
    Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers
    when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline
    JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'), they can still provide protections for users of older web
    browsers that don't yet support CSP.

Syntax:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    X-XSS-Protection: 0
    X-XSS-Protection: 1
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=<reporting-uri>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
where:
    0 --> Disables XSS filtering.
    1 --> Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is
        detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts).
    1; mode=block --> Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent
        rendering of the page if an attack is detected.
    1; report=<reporting-URI>  (Chromium only) --> Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting
        attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the
        functionality of the CSP report-uri directive to send a report.
