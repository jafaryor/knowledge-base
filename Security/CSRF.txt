Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    In this situation, someone includes an image that isn’t really an image
    (for example in an unfiltered chat or forum), instead it really is a
    request to your bank’s server to withdraw money:
        <img src="http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=bob&amount=1000000&for=mallory">

    Now, if you are logged into your bank account and your cookies are still
    valid (and there is no other validation), you will transfer money as soon
    as you load the HTML that contains this image. There are a few techniques
    that are used to prevent this from happening:
        * As with XSS, input filtering is important.
        * There should always be a confirmation required for any sensitive action.
        * Cookies that are used for sensitive actions should have a short lifetime only.
        * For more prevention tips, see the OWASP CSRF prevention cheat sheet.
