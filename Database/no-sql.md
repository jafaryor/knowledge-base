## No SQL
NoSQL is a non-relational DMS, that does not require a fixed schema, avoids joins, and is easy to scale.

NoSQL database is used for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs.

NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps.

## BASE model
Basically Available
Soft State
Eventually Consistent


## When to use
* When ACID support is not needed
* When Traditional RDBMS model is not enough
* Data which need a flexible schema
* Constraints and validations logic not required to be implemented in database
* Logging data from distributed sources
* It should be used to store temporary data like shopping carts, wish list and session data


## SQL vs NoSQL
* SQL is primarily called Relational Databases whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.
* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
* SQL databases have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases use dynamic schema for unstructured data.
* SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware.
