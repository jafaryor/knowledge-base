## Knowledge Sharing
#### Documentation
The biggest problem with documentation is that it becomes outdated super-fast.

#### Reverse engineering
Is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object;

#### Mentoring

#### Team Code Review
Code reviews pretty effectively distribute project-specific knowledge across the team.

#### Pair Programming
Pair programming is a form of mentoring. This interaction is the crucial part of the process and makes it really effective to learn with fast feedback loops.

With the pair programming technique, knowledge is easier to be transferred. Not only is domain knowledge shared, the system’s code can be easier inspected and refactored.

#### Face-to-face knowledge transfer (such as mentoring)
Probably takes more senior people’s time than just sending over documentation.

#### Brown Bag Lunch
Brown bags refer to the situation where people bring their own launch (usually in a brown bag) and eat their food together while getting to know each other and exchanging knowledge.

A brown bag lunch (BBL) allows team members a real-time exchange of knowledge and experience. It allows developers to socialize and get to know each other in a relaxed situation, and solve problems while it promotes learning and trust building.
