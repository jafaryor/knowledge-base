## Software Development Methodologies
Every business should decide on organizing the work process inside the company, according to its priorities and projects in development.
* #### Agile

    Agile software development is a conceptual framework for undertaking software engineering projects. There are a number of agile software development methodologies like Scrum, Crystal Methods and Dynamic Systems Development Model.

    The main goal of agile methods is minimizing the risk by developing software in short timeboxes, called iterations, which typically last one to four weeks. Each timebox is like a mini software project that includes all the tasks necessary to release the mini-increment of new functionality:
    * planning,
    * requirements analysis,
    * design,
    * coding,
    * testing, and
    * documentation.

    The iteration may not add enough functionality to warrant releasing the product, but an agile software project intends to be capable of releasing new software at the end of every iteration. After this iteration, the team reevaluates project priorities. Agile methods emphasize working product as the primary measure of the progress. Relative to the other methods Agile produce very little written documentation — the “real-time” is the preferable type of communication. Most of the development team members (and business owners too) are located nearby and can communicate face-to-face.

    __Pros__:
    * Adaptive approach that responds to changes favorably
    * Allows for direct communication to maintain transparency
    * Improved quality by finding and fixing defects quickly and identifying expectation mismatches early

    __Cons:__
    * Focuses on working with software and lacks documentation efficiency
    * Chances of getting off-track as outcome are not clear

* #### Waterfall

    The Waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several phases, typically:
    * analysis
    * software requirements specificationSoftware design
    * software design
    * testing
    * integration (if there are multiple subsystems)
    * deployment (or Installation)
    * maintenance

    The linear and rigid nature of this method makes it easy to understand and manage. So its ideal for less experienced managers and teams. In this method, distinct goals are accomplished. Each phase must be 100% complete before moving onto the next phase, no turning back to modify the project or direction. In theory, this process leads to the project being delivered on time because each phase has been planned in detail. It can be used for projects with clear objectives and stable requirements.

    But in practice, waterfall development often falls short of expectations as it does not embrace the inevitable changes and revisions that become necessary with most projects.

    Emphasis is on planning, time schedules, target dates, budgets and implementation of an entire system at one time. Tight control is maintained over the life of the project via extensive written documentation, formal reviews, and approval/signoff by the user and information technology management occurring at the end of most phases before beginning the next phase. Written documentation is an explicit deliverable of each phase.

    Despite its inflexibility and thoughts of being out of date, this methodology intended to get rid of unnecessary paperwork, time-consuming regular meetings, and backlogs. So, this is a great choice for the small projects where all the aspects of development are known beforehand and a bad solution for complicated projects since it is quite inflexible.

    __Pros:__
    * Easy to understand and functional
    * Simple enough to handle as model is rigid 
    * Saves significant amount of time
    * Allows for easy testing and analysis
    * It allows for departmentalization and managerial control

    __Cons:__
    * Only matches precise needs 
    * Not applicable for maintenance projects
    * Does not allow editing in the testing phase
    * No option to know possible outcome of a project
    * Not excellent for long and ongoing projects

* #### Scrum

    Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development.

    A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need (requirements volatility) and that there will. Scrum adopts an evidence-based empirical approach — accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team’s ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

    Main features of Scrum:
    * a living backlog of prioritized work to be done
    * completion of a fixed set of backlog items in a series of short iterations or sprints
    * a brief daily meeting (“a scrum”) for explaining the progress, describing an upcoming work and possible obstacles
    * a brief planning session in which the backlog items for the sprint will be defined
    * a brief heartbeat retrospective when all team members reflect about the past sprint

    Scrum is best suited when the cost of delay is high and deadlines should meet a minimal delay. Scrum is often used when the end product is unclear or the requirements have no proper feedback from the clients. Here the client is involved in the whole process and determine and focus on certain sprint product backlog items that need to be completed (along with the team). Scrum takes its place among flexible methodologies that are appropriate for long-run development with frequent changes to requirements.

    __Pros:__
    * Decision making lies in the hands of the team
    * Business requirement document is considered insignificant
    * Lightly controlled method empathizing with constant updating

    __Cons:__
    * The processing method suffers because of wavering costs
    * Not suitable for big sized projects
    * Requires highly expert team, which has no place for novices
