## Spiral SDLC Model
It is a combination of the Iterative and Waterfall SDLC models with the significant accent on the risk analysis. The main issue of the spiral model — is defining the right moment to make a step into the next stage. The preliminary set time frames are recommended as the solution to this issue.

Each loop of the spiral is called a _Phase_ of the software development process.

The spiral model has four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.

#### Application:
* When there is a budget constraint and risk evaluation is important.
* For medium to high-risk projects.
* Customer isn’t sure about the requirements.
* New product line which should be released in phases to get enough customer feedback.
* Significant changes are expected in the product during the development cycle.
* The projects with mid or high-level risk, where it is important to prevent these risks

#### Advantages:
* The scalability allow to make changes and add new functionality event at the relatively late stages.
* High amount of risk analysis
* Good for large and mission-critical projects.
* Software is produced early in the software life cycle.

#### Disadvantages:
* Management is more complex.
* End of the project may not be known early.
* Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.
* Process is complex.
* Spiral may go on indefinitely.
* Large number of intermediate stages requires excessive documentation.
* The risk control demands involvement of the highly-skilled professionals.
