## Agile SDLC Model
Agile model believes that every project needs to be handled differently and the existing methods need to be tailored to best suit the project requirements. In Agile, the tasks are divided to time boxes (small time frames) to deliver specific features for a release.

Iterative approach is taken and working software build is delivered after each iteration. Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer.

The most populat Agile methodoly is called __SCRUM__.

#### Advantages:
* Is a very realistic approach to software development.
* Promotes teamwork and cross training.
* Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated.
* Resource requirements are minimum.
* Suitable for fixed or changing requirements
* Delivers early partial working solutions.
* Good model for environments that change steadily.
* Minimal rules, documentation easily employed.
* Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.
* Little or no planning required.
* Easy to manage.
* Gives flexibility to developers.

#### Disadvantages:
* Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
* More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
* An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must without which it will not work.
* Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines.
* Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction.
* There is a very high individual dependency, since there is minimum documentation generated.
* Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation.
