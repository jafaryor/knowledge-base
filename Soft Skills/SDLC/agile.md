## Agile SDLC Model
In the agile methodology after every development iteration, the customer is able to see the result and understand if he is satisfied with it or he is not. This is one of the advantages of the agile software development life cycle model.

One of its disadvantages is that with the absence of defined requirements it is difficult to estimate the resources and development cost.

Extreme programming is one of the practical use of the agile model.

In Agile, the tasks are divided to time boxes (small time frames) to deliver specific features for a release. These time frames are called "Sprints" in Scrum methodology.

Iterative approach is taken and working software build is delivered after each iteration. Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer.

The most populat Agile methodoly is called __SCRUM__.

#### Application:
* The users needs change dynamically.
* Less price for the changes implemented because of the many iterations.
* Unlike the Waterfall model, it requires only initial planning to start the project.

#### Advantages:
* Is a very realistic approach to software development.
* Promotes teamwork and cross training.
* Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated.
* Resource requirements are minimum.
* Suitable for fixed or changing requirements
* Delivers early partial working solutions.
* Good model for environments that change steadily.
* Minimal rules, documentation easily employed.
* Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.
* Project is devided thanks to the flexible change process.
* Risks are minized thanks to the flexible change process.

#### Disadvantages:
* Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
* More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
* An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must, without which it will not work.
* Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines.
* Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction.
* Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation.
* Difficulties with measuring the final cost because of permanent changes.
* New requirements may conflict with the existing architecture.
