HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed
    for a given resource:
    * GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests
        using GET should only retrieve data.
    * HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request,
        but without the response body.
    * POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often
        causing a change in state or side effects on the server
    * PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource
        with the request payload.
    * DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
    * CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the
        target resource.
    * OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the
        target resource.
    * TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the
        target resource.
    * PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
