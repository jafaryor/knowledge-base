WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive
    communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API,
    you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without
    having to poll the server for a reply.

Interfaces:
    WebSocket
        The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then
        sending and receiving data on the connection.
    CloseEvent
        The event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.
    MessageEvent
        The event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.
