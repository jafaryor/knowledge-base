### Interview red flags
1. YOUR INTERVIEWER IS VERY LATE

    If they’re this rude at the interview, imagine how they would be as a manager.

2. HR BADMOUTHS (чернить) THE PERSON YOU’D BE REPLACING

    No hiring manager should ever speak ill about the person they are replacing. That shows poor character and judgment and also speaks poorly of the organization

3. YOUR WOULD-BE BOSS COULDN’T EXPLAIN THE ROLE CLEARLY

4. YOUR INTERVIEWER ASKS PERSONAL QUESTIONS

    An interview should be objective, not emotional.

5. CANDIDATE IS ANGRY WITH SIMPLE QUESTIONS

    Tell his it is standard process and you will move to harder questions soon.

    If he calms down, it is ok. If he is not, then it is reason for concern. Because he will have to work in team and juniors/middles could ask him such simple questions. Guess what he would do.
