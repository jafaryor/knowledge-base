### What steps do you take to motivate your team?
Two ways:
1. If you tend towards being friendly, approachable, and being seen as “one of the team”.

    Building a close working relationship between all team members will result in a natural increase in motivation – for example, organising team events, encouraging socialisation together outside of work, showing flexibility in working hours in return for extra hard work during busy times, and rewards for the entire team together.

2. If you feel like that method is too imprecise or too unprofessional, you can opt for a more serious and structured method of motivation

    At the most basic level, direct praise for a job well done is a powerful motivator, and done openly in front of other team members it will motivate everybody, not just the person already doing a good job.

    Bonuses, intangible but coveted rewards like “Employee of the Month” status, and the promise of promotion or further opportunities are all structured and distinct methods of driving improvement.

    Negative feedback is also extremely important in this style of management. Letting someone know when the work they have done is not good enough can be the push they need to do better, but it needs to be carefully balanced with praise to avoid demoralizing them.
