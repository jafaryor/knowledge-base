## TDD & BDD

Test-driven development (TDD), is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

Behavior Driven testing is an extension of TDD. Like in TDD in BDD also we write tests first and the add application code. The major difference that we get to see here are
* Tests are written in plain descriptive English type grammar
* Tests are explained as behavior of application and are more user focused
* Using examples to clarify requirements

Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that has emerged from TDD (Test Driven Development) but differs by being written in a shared language, which improves communication between tech and non-tech teams and stakeholders. In both development approaches, tests are written ahead of the code, but in BDD, tests are more user-focused and based on the systemâ€™s behavior.

Unit Testing gives you the __what__. Test-Driven Development gives you the __when__. Behavior Driven-Development gives you the __how__. Although you can use each individually, you should combine them for best results as they complement each other very nicely.
