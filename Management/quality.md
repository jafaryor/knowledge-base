## Quality Management
Quality is a measurable quantity.

There are six different dimensions quality measurement lies on

Quality management is a method for ensuring that all the activities necessary to design, develop and implement a product are effective and efficient with respect to the system and its performance.

As a result, quality management is method of supplying products or services that satisfies customers’ requirements. The main purpose of the quality management is achieving customer satisfaction.

### Measure the quality of a product
Software quality measures whether software satisfies its requirements. Software requirements are classified as either functional or non-functional.
* __Functional requirements__ specify what the software should do.

    Functional requirements could be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, or any other specific function that defines what an application is meant to accomplish.

* __Non-functional requirements__ specify how the system should work.

    Also known as “quality attributes” non-functional requirements include things like: _disaster recovery, portability, privacy, security, supportability, and usability._

[The Consortium for IT Software Quality](https://www.it-cisq.org/standards/) (__CISQ__) software quality model defines four important indicators of software quality:
* __Reliability__ is the risk of software failure and the stability of a program when exposed to unexpected conditions.
* __Performance__ refers to an application’s use of resources and how that affects its scalability, customer satisfaction, and response times.
* __Security__ assesses how well an application protects information against the risk of software breaches.
* __Maintainability__ is the ability of the system to support changes. Is the ease with which you can modify software, adapt it for other purposes, or transfer it from one development team to another.

> Software with more lines of code is harder to maintain, meaning changes are more likely to lead to errors.

The CISQ model provides a good platform for understanding software quality, but you can consider other aspects alongside CISQ to get a more holistic view of quality.
* __Rate of Delivery__ means how often new versions of software are shipped to customers.
* __Testability__ - how well the system allows performing tests, quality of documentation.
* __Usability__

    The user interface is the only part of the software visible to users, so it’s vital to have a good UI. Simplicity and task execution speed are two factors that lead to a better UI.
    
    Accessibility, Hot keys, List of suggestions, List of supported devices are also incuded.

### FURPS
FURPS is an acronym representing a model for classifying software quality attributes (functional and non-functional requirements):
* __Functionality__ - Capability (Size & Generality of Feature Set), Reusability (Compatibility, Interoperability, Portability), Security (Safety & Exploitability)

    is assessed by evaluating the feature set and capabilities of the program, the generality of the functions that are delivered, and the security of the overall system.

* __Usability__ (UX) - Human Factors, Aesthetics (эстетика), Consistency, Documentation, Responsiveness

    Is assessed by considering human factors , overall aesthetics, consistency, and documentation.

* __Reliability__ - Availability (Failure Frequency (Robustness/Durability/Resilience), Failure Extent & Time-Length (Recoverability/Survivability)), Predictability (Stability), Accuracy (Frequency/Severity of Error)

    Is evaluated by measuring the frequency and severity of failure, the accuracy of output results, the mean-time-to-failure (MTTF), the ability to recover from failure, and the predictability of the program.

* __Performance__ - Speed, Efficiency, Resource Consumption (power, ram, cache, etc.), Throughput, Capacity, Scalability

    Is measured by processing speed, response time, resource consumption, throughput, and efficiency.

* __Supportability__ (Serviceability, Maintainability, Sustainability, Repair Speed) - Testability, Flexibility (Modifiability, Configurability, Adaptability, Extensibility, Modularity), Installability, Localizability

    Is the ability of the system to provide useful information for identifying and solving problems.
