## Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
EQ is about how smart we are with the human connection. In other words, how effective we manage ourselves and our relationship.

> Emotion - is information. Emotions, or feelings, contain important data that's tied to our thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and actions, which is why being able to read emotions, your own and others

EQ has 4 main components:

|  | Self | Others |
| --- | --- | --- |
__Awareness__ | Self-awareness | Awareness of others |
__Management__ | Self-control | Bulding relationships |

Where:
* Self-awareness

    Focuses on how well you know yourself including: _Your values_, _Strength & Weaknesses_, in comparison to how others perceive you.

    1. Know what your are feeling and when
    2. Understand your values
    3. Know your purpose
    4. Access your skills
    5. Know your work style
    6. Know your leadership style

* Self-control

    Is about managing your emotions and actions in productive and healthy ways.

    There's two important windows for self-control:
    1. When under stress

        Your goal is to quickly recognize when you've been hijacked, then you want to be able to calm yourself down. Consider these methods:
        * Excusing yourself to the restroom so you can get out of the situation for a few minutes.
        * Breathing in and out for the count of five
        * Journaling, jotting down a few thoughts or feelings
        * Moving your body, like going for a walk.
        * Talking with a trusted friend.

        > The most important thing to remember is to not take any action until your brain is fully back online.

    2. When everything is going well

        Timing really is everything. Remember, you will rarely regret waiting a few hours or days, but you will often regret acting too quickly.

* Awareness of others

    Knowing their emotions and needs as well as skills, performance, and other aspects of diversity.

    It is also about extending empathy.

* Building relationship

    Is about how we utilize our awareness of others to maximize their potential and our relationship.

There 20 competencies within these quadrants. Competency has two aspects:
* Proficency - is how good you are at smth.
* Frequency - is how often you do smth when faced with the opportunity.

Amygdala Hijack - is when your brain under stress turns on reptilian brain, but other parts of brain is shut down. This emotional state makes us incapable of any kind of intelligent actions. It lowers both youe EQ and IQ (traditional intelligence).

As a leader you actually have three levels of responsibility for developing emotional intelligence. Here are four key strategies you can use everyday:
1. Role model EQ

    This will naturally happen as you stay focused on the competencies as you increase your proficiency and frequency.

2. Make EQ part of your core values

3. Create an env. that boosts EQ by offering learning programs on EQ

4. Hold your people and organization accountable

    It means clearly communicating expectations and holding people accountable for meeting them. There should be consequences when people don't meet minimum standards for self-control and engaging with others. For example, if bullying or harassment occur in your organization, you must address it.

    Be sure you also recognize and reward emotional intelligence because that's the best way to validate your words with concrete actions.


### Understand your triggers
Studies indicate that people who struggle to keep jobs or excel in their careers have problems with controlling their impulses or delaying gratification (наслаждение).

Our triggers are remnants (пережиток) of difficult experiences, either physical or emotional, that happened to us in the past. When we experience a similar situation or a person who reminds us, even subconsciously, of someone who hurt us, our body responds. The reason our emotional reaction is bigger than this situation warrants is because it's got connections to our past.

> Triggers are just the scars of old wounds.

In fact, there is not a human being alive who doesn't have triggers. It's just part of the human experience. Many triggers come from trauma.

#### Strategy to manage triggers:
1. Anticipate (ожидать) what or who will likely trigger you.

    Perhaps you can avoid the situation or change it enough to make it better for you.

2. Develop a "fire drill"

    This is your plan for once you've been triggered, so you can manage the reaction once it kicks off. Just like a real fire drill, it helps us to know what to do under stress. Consider these questions. How will you know you're triggered? What are some phrases you can have ready to say and even practice in advance? How can you gracefully get out of the situation?

3. Add mindfulness (осознанность) to your life.

    Meditation, in particular, teaches people to take an observer stance, learning to watch their own thoughts or feeling from a bit of a distance. That little bit of perspective helps people shift from being hijacked by a trigger to watching themselves be hijacked, which keeps them from making impulsive choices in the moment.

    So, it's important to give a triggered person a little time and space to cool down. Say something like:

    `"I can tell, you have strong feelings about this, why don't we take a quick break for a few minutes; go take a walk or grab a snack and we'll reconvene (возобновить работу) in a bit."`

4. Triggers are at the heart of conflicts

    Psychologists have long known that the hierarchy of any organization tends to mirror the hierarchy of a family unit. So, it's fairly common for people, even leaders, to unknowingly play out unhealed family issues at work. Explore how you can provide people with the tools and skills they need to increase their EQ and bring their best selves to work.


### Self-care
Today, many top leaders include mindfulness practices in their daily routine. Whether it's meditation, yoga, or expressing gratitude, mindfulness plays a powerful role in our brains.

Dr. Sara Lazar at Harvard found that a daily mindfulness practice actually shrinks the amygdala, making it less reactive.

Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin uses MRIs to compare the brains of long-time meditators, like Tibetan monks, to people who have never meditated. The results are astounding.

Even meditating one time changes the brain in a measurable way. And it's permanent. Regular meditators are able to focus longer, less likely to worry about future events. And when something stressful does happen, they experience less distress and return quickly to their normal state.

### Practicing sustainability
Sustainability - keeping yourself in good shape so that you can meet and respond to the daily challenges over time.

#### Strategy
1. Keep yourself physicaly and emotionally strong.
2. Nutrition (питание)

    * Keeps immune system strong, so you could fight stress.

3. Meditative activities

    Provides:
    * Stress reduction
    * Clarity and inspiration
    * Good ideas

4. Sleep

    The rule of thumb: When you wake up naturally without the need of an alarm clock, that is how many hours you need.

    * Reduce the use of media at least 1 hour before bedtime.
    * Play


### Developing resilience
The ability to recover quickly from adversity (неблагоприятная обстановка).

Resilience is a 2 phase process:
1. Self protection

    With the person assessing and reducing potential sources of adversity.

    * Using emotional intelligence
    * Developing key relationship
    * Scanning your industry
    * Facilitating the change process.

2. Promote well being

    Focus on promoting well being to effectively bounce back from the effects of adversity when it does happen.

#### Strategy
1. Practice sustainability by taking care of yourself
2. Spend time with a supportive social netwoek
3. Express feelings

    Researche has shon that feelings need to be outwardly expressed either through talking or writing in order to be truly processed and shifted.

4. Practice gratitude daily

    As you go to bed, identify 3 things that you are grateful for. The goal is to find 3 new tings and only repeating after you have gone 15 days.

5. Keep your sense of humor


### Empathy
__Empathy__ is the awareness of and connection to others' feelings, needs, and concerns. Empathy does not mean that you'd feel the same thing if you were in the same situation.

> When people feel truly seen and heard, they become fiercely loyal.

The good news is that we are biologically wired to feel empathy for others. Several structures in our brains are dedicated to perceiving facial expressions, hearing vocal cues, and reading body language. That's why we all have had the experience of asking someone how they are, and while they say the words I'm fine, the other clues are telling you that they're not. Having empathy means you pay attention to these clues and use them as an opportunity for connection. Say something like:

`"I get the feeling that you don't really feel fine. Would you like to talk about this with me? How can I best support you?"`

Then listen. And find a way from your own past to connect with the feelings or experiences that they share with you.

Being a great leader is about extending empathy to those above, beside, and below you in the organization.

### Leading others
#### Provide Safety
__Bullying__ is abusive conduct (поведение) that is characterized by regular repetition, ongoing duration, and escalation with increasing aggression. Alarmingly, workplace bullying is 4 times more common than either sexual harassment or racial discrimination on the job.

__Psychological safety__ as a sense of confidence the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes. It is a shared belief that the team is safe for risk taking. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.

Dr. Amy Edmondson coined this term. She found that across industries, psychological safety is the key element that differentiates the highest performing teams from the rest.

Research also tells us that a _sense of belonging and inclusion_ matters. Brain registers exclusion in the same way it registers physical pain.

#### Four Gates to Peak Team Performance.
Many aspects of our biology are designed to help us work well in groups, achieving what scientists call neural synchrony, which is a hallmark (отличительный признак) of peak performance. However, we can only get there when certain conditions are met:
1. Safety

    Physical safety + Psychological Safety/Inclusion

2. Purpose

    Purpose + Strength > Sense of We

3. Trust and Belonging

    Trust + Respect > Rhythm of Team + Collaboration

4. Peak Performance

    Innovation + Transformation

Studies indicate that the __ideal team size__ is between __4__ and __8__ people. Research has shown that three people is unstable because it creates a two against one dynamic and nine or more actually yields diminishing productivity because people feel less accountable for their efforts.

#### Catalyzing change
The success of every organization rests on its ability to change.

> Humans are actually wired to resist change.

There are four brain structures that can be activated by change: driving fear, fatigue (утомительность), and ultimately failure.

Is change needed?
1. Look at your organization and market state
2. Look at workforce trends
3. Identify any skills gaps
4. Study customers

    What patterns do you see in how they use your product or service?

5. Ask what disruptive (подрывающий) forces may challenge your organization

Every organization has a natural bell-shaped curve of development. The organization is created and then starts to grow. When it becomes successful everyone wants to celebrate. As it achieves its peak most people are really resistant to change. You'll hear comments like this is working, don't mess with success. Or why fix something that's not broken? But if you hang out too long in your glory days you'll find yourself sliding down the backside of achievement. And the longer you wait to identify the signs the harder it gets to recover. Timing is everything with change. You want to be ahead of the curve. This means that you have to be thinking beyond the current situation and identifying the next launching point for your company.

#### Inspirational Leader
Don't confuse leadership with charisma. Quiet people can inspire, and humble people can be amazing leaders.

When you have a purpose that you care deeply about, others feel your authenticity and are inspired by your commitment.

Now, a natural part of this process is that some people will fall away because they don't share your values or vision. That's okay.

Finally, don't wait until you have an official or formal leadership role. Leadership is really a practice, not a position. Anyone can lead, and often the best leaders are not the ones with the titles. If you lead from your values and your passion, you will make an impact.
