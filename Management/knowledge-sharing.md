## Knowledge Sharing
#### Documentation
The biggest problem with documentation is that it becomes outdated super-fast.

#### Reverse engineering
Is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object;

#### Mentoring

#### Team Code Review
Code reviews pretty effectively distribute project-specific knowledge across the team.

#### Pair Programming
Pair programming is a form of mentoring. This interaction is the crucial part of the process and makes it really effective to learn with fast feedback loops.

With the pair programming technique, knowledge is easier to be transferred. Not only is domain knowledge shared, the system’s code can be easier inspected and refactored.

In __Pair Programming__ there are always two people working on a single piece of code at the same time on the same machine. One who writes the code is called __driver__ and another constantly reviews it as it is being written, he is called __navigator__. They constantly switch roles.

The key advantage is the quality of the code. It brings the best possible solution as two minds are better than one.

Pros:
* Having 2 sets of eyes on code generally increases the quality of the code
* When one person gets tired or stuck, the pair can step in and help out (assuming one person is the main driver)
* Pairing facilitates knowledge transfer
* Pairing results in both programmers being intimately familiar with the code they worked on (as long as they both were engaged)

Cons:
* You are using 2 programmers instead of 1 (costly from a business perspective)
* If there is a huge discrepancy in skill between the pairs, the more experienced pair might lose patience, and the less experienced pair might lose confidence
If the pairs don’t get along or aren’t compatible, the session will not be effective

#### Face-to-face knowledge transfer (such as mentoring)
Probably takes more senior people’s time than just sending over documentation.

#### Brown Bag Lunch
Brown bags refer to the situation where people bring their own launch (usually in a brown bag) and eat their food together while getting to know each other and exchanging knowledge.

A brown bag lunch (BBL) allows team members a real-time exchange of knowledge and experience. It allows developers to socialize and get to know each other in a relaxed situation, and solve problems while it promotes learning and trust building.
